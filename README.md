# Budge - A Budget Projection App

Welcome to Budge! Tons of information about this application can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/gzapata90/budgetProjectionApp/wiki)!

For running the individual parts, check out their respective READMEs in the frontend and backend folders.

In order to run the backend on heroku, we needed the Procfile to be in the root of the project, as well as a root package.json for node-detection.
All other non-class-deliverable items should be in either the backend or frontend folders. 

The running frontend is found here: The live site is running at: https://budgetprojectionapp.firebaseapp.com/
